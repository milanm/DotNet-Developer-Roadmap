## Understanding the .NET ecosystem

Before going into specifics, you need to have a solid understanding of the **.NET Ecosystem**. Here are a few that you should understand:

## .NET runtimes

In this section, we will look at the main .NET runtimes. We consider .NET runtime as anything that implements **[ECMA-335 Standard for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dotnet-standards.md)**.

### .NET Framework

[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) is a software development framework for building and running applications on Windows. .NET Framework consists of Common Language Runtime (CLR), .NET Framework Class Library, and Application workloads (WPF, Windows Forms, and ASP.NET). CLR is part of a shared infrastructure that runs code, jit, does garbage collection (C#, VB.NET, F#), etc. The code that CLR manages is called managed code. Code is compiled into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and stored in assemblies (with .exe or .dll extension). When an application runs, CLR takes an assembly and uses a just-in-time compiler (JIT) to transpile machine code into code that can run on specific computer architecture.

You can use it for both desktop and web development, but it is limited to Windows development, and it comes preinstalled on Windows.

### .NET Core

[.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) is one of the runtimes in the .NET Ecosystem. It was released in 2016. and it's [open-sourced](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It does not represent a new version of the .NET Framework and will not replace it. It is an entirely independent version, built to allow cross-platform capability for application development. .NET Core consists of an App Host (dotnet.exe) that runs CLR and Library. It has a Common language runtime (CoreCLR) and .NET Core Class Library. It supports different application workloads, such as ASP.NET Core (MVC and API), console applications, and UWP (currently).

.NET Core can run on different platforms: Windows Client, Server, IoT, Linux, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Tizen, and Mac OSX, and can be installed side-by-side of different versions per machine or user.


### The One .NET - .NET 5

[.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) was released in November 2020 with the goal of unifying development for desktop, Web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, and AI applications. The earlier setup goal was to produce a single .NET runtime and framework, cross-platform, integrating the best features of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and Mono. However, due to the global health pandemic, the unification was postponed to .NET 6. .NET 5 is a shared code base for .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, and future .NET implementations. Also, target framework names (TFMs), which express which version of .NET targeting, are updated, so we now have net5.0. This is for code that runs everywhere. It combines and replaces the netcoreapp and netstandard names and net5.0-windows that represent OS-specific flavors of .NET 5 that include net5.0 plus OS-specific bindings.

### The current - .NET 8

[.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8) is the latest runtime in the .NET Ecosystem. It is released in November 2023. and it unifies development for desktop, Web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, and AI applications. .NET 8 consists of an App Host (dotnet.exe) that runs CLR and Library. It has a Common language runtime (CoreCLR) and .NET 8 Class Library. It also includes ASP.NET Core 8. .NET 8 has nearly identical platform support as .NET Core 3.1 for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

.NET 8 is a **Long Term Support (LTS)**. Those releases are supported for three years after the initial release.

.NET 7 was a **Standard Term Support** release, supported for six months after a subsequent STS or LTS release.

## .NET Standard

Different runtimes use different class libraries, e.g., .NET Framework uses .NET Framework class library, while .NET Core contains its class library, as well as Xamarin with its class library. In this way, it's hard to share code between different runtimes, as they use different APIs. Microsoft's solution is the **.NET Standard library**, released in 2016. It represents a set of (formal) specifications that say which APIs you can use and all runtimes implement it. It is the evolution of Portable Class Libraries (PCL). Specific runtimes implement specific versions of .NET Standard (implementing specific APIs). E.g., .NET Framework 4.8.1 implements .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET 7 implements .NET Standard 2.1 ([link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-1-0#net-implementation-support)).

### 4. Client-Side .NET

If you want to build UIs in .NET, you will need these frameworks. **Razor** is a template engine for creating dynamic HTML, while **Blazor** takes it up a notch, letting you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. **MAUI** is a Xamarin successor made for building cross-platform mobile apps. **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** is a UI framework that creates desktop client applications. Uno Platform is an open source cross-platform graphical user interface that allows WinUI and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) - based code to run on iOS, macOS, Linux, Android, and WebAssembly.

**Resources**:

### 5. Databases

Good database design ensures efficient data storage and quick retrieval, making your app run smoother and scale easier. **SQL**, the go-to language for database interaction, gives you the power to query, update, and manage the data you've so carefully designed to store.

Here, you need to know:

- SQL Syntax
- Basics of Database design (normal forms, keys, relationships)
- The Difference Between Inner, Left, Right, and Full Join
- SQL Queries Execution Order
- What is Query Optimizer

**Resources**:

- Tools:
  - [SQLFlow](https://sqlflow.gudusoft.com/#/) - a great tool to visualize SQL queries.

### 6. ORM

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is like a translator between your object-oriented C# code and the relational database, eliminating the tedious task of writing SQL queries for basic CRUD operations. Using ORM frameworks like Entity Framework, you can **manipulate data as objects in your code, making it more readable and maintainable**. This speeds up development, minimizes errors, and lets you focus on complex business logic rather than wrestling with database syntax.

For **Entity Framework**, you need to know the following:

- DbContext and DbSet for managing database connections and querying data
- Code-First and Database-First approaches for defining data models
- Migrations for managing database schema changes
- Querying data using LINQ and raw SQL
- Tracking changes and saving data

**Resources**:

- [ADO.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/)

### 7. Caching

Caching is like your app's personal short-term memory, storing frequently accessed data so it **can be quickly retrieved without accessing your database**. By reducing database load and speeding up data access, caching gives your app the competitive edge it needs to meet user demands for responsiveness and availability.

**Resources**:

- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- Application-Level
   - [Built-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/response)
   - [Output Caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/output?source=recommendations)

### 8. Logging

Logging captures runtime information, errors, and other crucial data that can help you quickly identify and fix issues, making your application more reliable and secure. Logging frameworks like **NLog** or **Serilog** integrate seamlessly into .NET, giving you a real-time diagnostic tool indispensable for monitoring application health, troubleshooting problems, and even gathering insights for future development. 

**Resources**:

- [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)
- [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog)
- [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging)

### 9. Communication

In .NET we have three types of communication: Real-time communication, Synchronous, and Asynchronous communication. **Real-time communication** technologies, like SignalR in the .NET ecosystem, enable these functionalities by maintaining a constant connection between server and client. **Synchronous communication** is mainly done by using through HTTP Client, while **asynchronous communication** is done through different messaging and event-based frameworks and libraries. Messaging systems act as a middleman between different parts of your system, allowing them to communicate without being directly connected. **Event handlers**, on the other side, are used for handling events within a single application. They facilitate a publisher-subscriber model where one part of the application can raise an event that other parts can react to.

**Resources**:

Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based on security and billing boundaries. The cloud **runs on servers in data centers**, but the abstractions cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single "platform" or large application. The ability to quickly provision, configure, and secure resources with cloud providers has been key to the tremendous success and complexity of modern DevOps.

The most popular cloud providers in the market are **AWS** and **Azure**, as well as **Google Cloud**.

Here, you must know how to manage users and administration, networks, virtual servers, etc.

**Resources**:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)

### 15. Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

CI/CD automates the building, testing, and deployment stages into a streamlined, error-resistant pipeline. This means **faster releases, bug fixes, and more time to focus on feature development**.

Here you need to know how to:

- Build and deployment tools (MSBuild, dotnet CLI)
- Version control systems (Git, Azure DevOps)
- CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Jenkins, TeamCity)

**Resources**:

- [DevOps concepts](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/devops-roadmap-2023)

### 16. NET Libraries

Some useful .NET libraries. Note that not all libraries will be used by everyone, it mainly depends on a project you work on.

- **[MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)** - Mediator pattern implementation in .NET
- **[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)** - Fault-handling library that allows expressing policies such as Retry and Circuit Breaker.
- **[Fluent Validation](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation)** - .NET validation library for building strongly-typed validation rules.
- **[Benchmark.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet)** - .NET library for benchmarking.
- **[Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit)** - Turns your REST API into a live interface.
- **[YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/)** - Reverse proxy server.
- **[Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)** - Swagger tools for documenting API's built on ASP.NET Core.

## Additional considerations

In addition to this, you also need to know the following:

### Performance best practices

Performances play an essential role in .NET applications. Here you need to know:

#### Profiling and diagnostics

These tools can help you identify and debug different performance bottlenecks you have in your code. For this, you can use other tools, such as:

- [PerfView](https://joshthecoder.com/2023/10/23/using-perfview-to-diagnose-high-cpu-in-an-aspnet-app.html)
- [Visual Studio Profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/profiling-feature-tour?view=vs-2022)
- [dotTrace](https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/) and [dotMemory](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotmemory/)

#### Performances 101

Along with tools, you should be aware of different performance best practices for .NET:

- **Caching** (in-mem Memory Cache or Redis)

- **Database Optimization** (optimize queries, proper indexing, connection pooling)

- **Async Programming** (offload all CPU extensive or I/O bound operations to DB, file systems, ext. systems)

- **Use Entity Framework wisely** (use eager loading, projections, and optimizations like compiled queries)

- **Memory management** (use value types and be cautious with large object graphs. Use dispose pattern to db connections or streams. Avoid boxing/unboxing. Use StringBuilder instead of String for a large number of concatenations.)

- **HTTP Caching** (use ETags, Last-Modified headers)

- **Minimize Round-Trips** (reduce the number of HTTP requests and database round-trips)

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** (Offload static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) to CDNs for faster delivery to users)

- **Compression** (Enable GZIP or Brotli compression for HTTP responses to reduce data transfer size)

- **Logging and Tracing** (Avoid excessive logging in production. Use distributed tracing across microservices.)

- **Parallelism and Concurrency** (Utilize parallelism and multithreading for CPU-bound tasks using Parallel class or Task Parallel Library (TPL))

- **Resource Optimization** (Optimize images and assets for the Web to reduce load times)

- **HTTP2 over SSL** (now make intelligent decisions about the page content)

- **Measure and Monitor Performance** (use VS Diagnostic Tools, App Insights, or BenchmarkDotNet)

- **User Span<> instead of collections** (spans can represent a contiguous section of memory; this means we can use them to operate over arrays)

### Security and Cryptography

Security plays an essential role in application development. The most critical aspects of security in the .NET world are:

- [**Authentication and Authorization**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/authentication-and-authorization-in-aspnet-web-api) concepts:
  - Cookies
  - ASP.NET Core Identity for user management
  - .NET OIDC middleware
  - OAuth and OpenID Connect for 3rd-party authentication
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication
  - Role-based and claims-based authorization

- [**Cryptography and Data Protection**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cross-platform-cryptography) concepts:
  - Symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms
  - .NET Core Data Protection APIs
  - Hashing and digital signatures
  - Secure random number generation
